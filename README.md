# dotfiles

Intended to be used with the various dotfiles and simple shell scripts that one might want to reuse across computers.

Put your own dotfiles/way of managing them in a folder specific for you i.e. `mike/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`
Keep in mind, this might be mirrored to github at some point, so don't leave passwords/keys here. (It's also in the public team folder...)

So long as we follow that convention, there shouldn't be any conflicts.
